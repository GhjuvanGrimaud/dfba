# Final things to finish before submission

## Models as combine archives
- create latest version of models

- create combine archives for DFBA simulations (simple SED-ML timecourse + SBML files + some documentation)
- biomass weighting
- create figures and run simulations with COMBINE archives

## Guidelines
- check guidelines against created examples

## Numerical comparison
- create numerical results and compare with Leandros files
  - toy_wholecell
  - toy_atp
  - diauxic
- update information about numerical comparison in manuscript

## Software
- release latest version of sbmlutils supporting the full set of DFBA simulations
- update sbmlutils reference with latest zenodo in manuscript
- release cy3sbml with comp changes

## Manuscript
- figures in high quality  
  - Figure S3: load latest diauxic model, save session
  - Figure 4, 5, 6: pdf from latest simulation, figure 5 add data
