# Final things to finish before submission

## Models as combine archives
- create latest version of models
- biomass weighting
- create combine archives for DFBA simulations (simple SED-ML timecourse + SBML files + some documentation)
- create figures and run simulations with COMBINE archives

## Guidelines
- check guidelines against created examples

## Numerical comparison
- create numerical results and compare with Leandros files
- update information about numerical comparison in manuscript

## Software
- release latest version of sbmlutils supporting the full set of DFBA simulations
- update sbmlutils reference with latest zenodo in manuscript

## Manuscript
- figures in high quality
  - Figure 1: boxes same width, Write Results (CSV)
  - Figure 2: add legend, add framework info, add extension info
  - Figure 3: load latest model, save session, create legend  
  - Figure S3: load latest diauxic model, save session, create legend
  - Figure 4, 5, 6: pdf from latest simulation, figure 5 add data
