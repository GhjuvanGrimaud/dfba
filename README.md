# dfba - Encoding Dynamic Flux Balance Analysis in SBML
![SBML](./docs/images/sbml.png) 
![SED-ML](./docs/images/sedml.png)
![CombineArchive](./docs/images/omex.png)

Model examples encoded in the proposed dynamic FBA scheme.

All example models are listed in the `models` folder with individual models providing
* SBML model
* SED-ML file 
* Results for `iBioSim` and `sbmlutils`
* Combine archive for the exchange

The models can be simulated either with [iBioSim](http://www.async.ece.utah.edu/ibiosim) or [sbmlutils](https://github.com/matthiaskoenig/sbmlutils/).
